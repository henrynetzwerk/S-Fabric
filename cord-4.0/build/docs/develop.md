# Developing for CORD

This guide describes how to develop for CORD. It includes two example
workflows, one based on a lightweight development environment that runs on a
laptop and a more realistic environment that runs an emulated version of a CORD
POD. It also documents the key elements involved in developing services that
can be on-boarded into CORD.
