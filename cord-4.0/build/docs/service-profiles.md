# Service Profiles

This guide describes each of the service profiles that can be built on top of the CORD platform. The content in this guide is currently thin, but this is the place to document various profiles going forward.

Both *Services* and *Service Profiles* are classified as either

* **Official** – Passed QA tests, officially approved by the TST, to be supported in maintenance releases.

* **Development** –  Not fully tested, included in the release for evaluation, not currently supported.

These classifications are defined by the CORD
[Technical Steering Team (TST)](https://wiki.opencord.org/display/CORD/Technical+Steering+Team)
and subject to change.
