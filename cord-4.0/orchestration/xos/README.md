## Getting Started with XOS and CORD

XOS is now packaged as a project in the larger CORD open source
initiative, with source code managed through
`https://gerrit.opencord.org`. It is also mirrored at:

 * `https://github.com/opencord`
 * `Https://github.com/open-cloud`

the latter of which corresponds to the configuration of XOS we run
on [OpenCloud](http://www.opencloud.us).

Up-to-date information about XOS is available at the [CORD
Wiki](https://wiki.opencord.org). Additional information is available
at the original [XOS web site](http://xosproject.org), but it is now
somewhat dated.

The best way to get started with XOS is to bring up a "Single Node
CORD POD," as described
[here](https://wiki.opencord.org/display/CORD/Build+a+CORD+POD). This
version is configured with a service graph that includes
`ExampleService`, which is a good platform for understanding how to
build and use XOS.
