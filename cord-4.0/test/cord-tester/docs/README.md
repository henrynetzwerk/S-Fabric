# Testing CORD

CORD Tester is an automation framework used to test CORD. The
framework currently includes extensions to test R-CORD, with
extensions for other flavors of CORD in progress.

The framework is modular, making it easy to test all the components
that make up CORD. It supports both end-to-end tests and
functional tests of individual components.

The suite of tests is constantly evolving, with the latest testing plan
maintained on the
[CORD wiki](https://wiki.opencord.org/display/CORD/System+Tests),
including the latest list of
[functional test](https://wiki.opencord.org/display/CORD/Functional)
and
[performance/scaling tests](https://wiki.opencord.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3014702).
Also see the [Jenkins dashboard](https://jenkins.opencord.org/) for
results from recent runs.
