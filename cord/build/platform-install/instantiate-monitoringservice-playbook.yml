# instantiate-monitoringservice.yml
# Adds the monitoringservice to the currently running pod
# TODO: Due to some timing issues, the monitroing service synchronizer is not completely getting
# onboarded with in the retries of onboard-monitoringservice.yml, so the ansible script would
# eventually fail. Until it is fixed, once monitoring service synchronizer is ready, run this
# ansible playbook which has only tasks for instantiating the monitoring service models.
